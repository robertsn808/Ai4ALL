AI4ALL Project Proposal

Topic of Interest:
Carbon Dioxide Emissions of the World

Summary:
    Did you know that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) can reside in our atmosphere for thousands of years? Why are we talking about CO2 and why should you care?
It can be difficult to address an issue that is not easily noticeable if the issue is not an issue, unless the behavior of this issue is observed and recorded over a long period of time. The data recorded from observations will need to be inspected to discover the embedded messages the data holds.
Analyzing the accumulation of CO2 data gathered over a long period of time can show the difference between the amount of CO2 produced in the distant past and the current production of carbon dioxide. It can be observed that climate change, respiratory diseases, and changes to our planet’s ecosystem is proportional to the increase of CO2 in our atmosphere.
Global warming has been a topic of discussion for many years with carbon dioxide being one of the main contributors. If we are to maintain a sustainable future for those to continue our lineage, pinpointing sources of carbon dioxide can advance the development of a refined solution for global warming. Based on 28 years of gathered data from 194 different countries, we can easily identify the countries that seem to be promoting global warming through their carbon emissions. 
Artificial intelligence will allow us to easily digest what to a human may seem like mass amounts of information. By feeding our AI data, the data can be manipulated and organized in various ways. Each individual expression of CO2 data allows for a multitude of interpretations that may generate a possible reasoning to focus our attention to certain regions of the world if we are to reduce emissions. We can also use machine learning techniques to predict what emission levels will look like if the trends continue to persist
By using artificial intelligence, we can further our understanding of AI while being proactively utilized in the solution development of a common crisis for humanity in hopes for a more sustainable future.

Technical Component:
    Through coding in python, we will gain the ability to analyze data relevant to global warming. Our analysis will include the use of data visualization by outputting graphs of the data over time that was retrieved by the analysis. We will also depict the predicted trend of our data to show what will happen if the world progresses as is and no interventions are acted on in diminishing the causes of global warming. 

Medium options:
    We plan to utilize a slideshow to represent our retrieved data visualization including graphs and charts. We hope that the employment of a slideshow accompanied by our visualizations convinces our audience that CO2 emissions are an important concern that should be addressed by our community. If time permits, we could also create a dashboard that users can interact with to see the change over time of CO2 emissions.

Contingency Plan:
    As determined students, we will continue the project to the best of our ability. Each team member’s contribution towards our project is appreciated and will not be forgotten if unable to continue. We all understand what it means to work in a team; and as a team, whether members of the team are able to continue or not, will complete what we’re capable of completing for the remainder of the project.
    When needed, we will seek outside help and guidance from our TA, instructor, classmates and online communities. We will also have and maintain open communication between all team members so we can redistribute our project workload accordingly.
